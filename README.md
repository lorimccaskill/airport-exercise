Airport Exercise 

This small project is a succinct example of how I work. The Airport Exercise is a test that asked me to design and implement a single-page application that calculates and displays, given user input, the distance between two airports.

* z_originalFiles contains the documents provided for the design/code test.
* README.txt (found in z_originalFiles) includes full instructions for the test.

You can see the project in action [here](http://fewwords.org/testing/airportExercise/index.html).
